The problems that I encoutered during the tests
*********************************
I had a problem with STM32L031 Nucleo board USART communication.

I am trying to send data to PC on USART periodically and catch the spesific character ('a') with Rx interrupt and toggle the onboard LED when microcontroller receives any of it.

Here is the problems that I encountered during the test:

 - Microcontroller sent the data periodically to PC but the data was corrupted when it came to PC. The    original string was "STM32L031 USART Test" but when it received from PC it was "S⸮M3⸮⸮03⸮⸮USA⸮Ԡ⸮e⸮t" .

 - When I send the 'a' character from PC to microcontroller; the interrupt handler successfully triggered    and toggled the LED. After receiving the data, microcontroller stopped to send data to PC but continue     receiving the character and triggering the interrupt handler successfully.
 
I used the ST's Low Level Drivers (LL) in my program, here is my routines.

*********************************

After some tests I fixed the problem, now everything works as I expected. What do for fix the problem is:

 - I added the USART RXNE interrupt enable function after the NVIC configuration
 - I disabled the SYSCFG clock (I dont know how it solves the problem but it works for me). I founded it during my tests.
 - I checked the "use memory layout from target dialog" seciton at the Linker tab in the Options of KEIL IDE (I examined ST's exapmle projects    and then I noticed it was checked).
